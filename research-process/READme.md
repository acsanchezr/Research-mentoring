## Research Process Overview

#### Based on my personal experience conducting research in Human-Robot Interaction, Sociology, and as a CDT intern, the research process roughly looks as follows:

1. Development of a good research question.
2. Operationalization of variables (i.e., define your concepts of interest).
3. Literature review. Investigate what is known about your research topic. This part involves lots of reading!
4. Development of a hypothesis (or hypotheses) based on prior work (i.e., literature review).
5. Development of a methodology. Choose an approach for answering your research question (e.g., lab experiment; survey).
6. Study implementation.
7. Data collection and analysis.
8. Reporting findings.

#### Here you will find more details on how to approach each of the above steps :)
